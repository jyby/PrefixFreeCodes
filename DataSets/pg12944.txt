OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.

The origin of the phrase, _Le Coup de Jarnac_, is interesting, and
the story is well told by Mr. _MAC_DOWALL in Mac_millan's Magazine_.
Good, this, for "The Two Macs."

[Illustration]

In _The Argosy_, edited by Mr. CHARLES WOOD, there are two good most
seasonable Ghost Stories, by CHARLES W. WOOD, the "Rev. F.O.W." The
first is not new, as there is a similar legend attached to several old
Manor Houses, one of a Sussex Family House, the Baron had first-hand,
from a witness on the premises. It lacked corroboration at the time,
and is likely to do so.

The Letters passing between a fine young English Cantab, "all of the
modern style," and his family at home, are uncommonly amusing. _Harry
Fludyer at Cambridge_ is the title of the book, published by CHATTO
AND WINDUS. Well, to quote the ancient witticism in vogue _tempore
EDOUARDI RECTI et DON PAOLO BEDFORDI_ (the great Adelphoi, or rather
the great "Fill-Adelphians," as they were once called), "Things is
werry much as they used to was" at Cambridge, and University life of
to-day differs very little from that of yesterday, or the day before,
or the day before that. "_Hæc olim meminisse juvabit_," when, half a
century hence, the rollicking author of these letters--which, by the
way, first appeared in _The Granta_--is telling his _Minimus_ what "a
dog," he, the writer, was, and what "a day he used to have," in the
merry time that's past and gone. "His health and book!" quoth the
Baron.

A more muddle-headed story than _The Missing Member_ I have not read
for some considerable time.

The Baron sends HACHETTE & CIE.'S "_Mon Premier Alphabet_," and the
moral tale of "_Mlle. Marie Sans-souci_," up to the nursery where they
will be much appreciated by the little Barons.

"LETT's get a Diary," quoth a Barren Jester, not _the_ Baron DE B.W.,
who, had it not been Christmas time, would have expelled the witty
youth. "No joke, if you please," quoth he, "about LETTS's Diaries. We
may advertise these useful and hardy annuals in canine Latin and say,
'_Libera nos_!' i.e., Letts out!"

BARON DE BOOK-WORMS & Co.

_P.S._ I have it on the best authority that Mrs. SUTHERLAND EDWARDS,
Author of _The Secret of the Princess; a Tale of Country, Camp, Court,
Convict, and Cloister Life in Russia_, is about to produce a highly
sensational work, entitled _The Bargain of the Barmaid; a Story of
Claret, Cheese, Coffee, Cognac, and Cigar Life in London_.

CINDERELLA; FIN DE SIÈCLE.

(_A FAIRY TALE FOR CHRISTMAS._)

The Lady Help was busy at her domestic duties when her Godmother
knocked at the kitchen-door, and entered.

"Alas, poor CINDERELLA!" said the Fairy, in a compassionate tone, "and
so your stepmother and sisters have gone to the Prince's ball, and
left you to cleanse the pots and pans?"

"Thank you," returned her God-daughter; "I am perfectly well satisfied
to be left with my books. As a matter of fact, dances bore me."

And she carelessly glanced at some mathematical works that she had
used when cramming for the Senior Wranglership.

"Nonsense, my dear," responded the well-intentioned Fairy, "Get me a
pumpkin, some mice--"

"Quite out of date," interrupted CINDERELLA. "I presume you intend to
turn the pumpkin into a great coach, and so forth. Eh?"

"Well," admitted the Fairy, taken aback, "ye-es."

"Quite so. Believe me, the idea is distinctly old-fashioned. Pray
understand, I don't say you can't do it. Nowadays, with EDISON and
KOCH, it would be dangerous to suggest that anything was impossible.
No, I merely object to travel in a conveyance that will naturally be
redolent of the odours of the kitchen garden, and to be driven by a
coachman derived from a rodent."

"But this objection is contrary to precedent," urged the Fairy. "You
ought to express unbounded delight, and then depart in your carriage
with the greatest _éclat_ possible."

"You are most kind, but, if I am to do anything of _that_ sort, I
would prefer leaving the matter in the hands of Mr. Sheriff AUGUSTUS
HARRIS who thoroughly understands the entire business."

"It seems to me," said the Fairy, "you are very ungrateful. But surely
you want a magnificent costume?"

"Thanks, no; I get everything from Paris."

"And you think of the feelings of your _modiste_, and ignore those
of your poor old (but well-preserved) Godmother!" And the Fairy was
nearly moved to tears.

"Oh, I did not mean to pain you!" exclaimed CINDERELLA. "Stay, my dear
Lady, do you believe in hypnotism? No? Well, I do, and exercise it.
Pardon me!"

And as she made a few passes, the Fairy sank into a mesmeric trance.
Then, CINDERELLA desired that her Godmother should imagine that she
had been the heroine of a Fairy Story.

"Dear me," cried the now-satisfied dame, as she regained
consciousness; "and so you went to the ball, lost your slipper, and
married the Prince?"

"That was the impression I wished to convey to you. And now, my dear,
good Lady, I am afraid I must ask you to leave me."

And as the Fairy disappeared, CINDERELLA resumed her self-imposed
tasks of making an omelette and squaring the circle.

CHAPTER LXVII.

The fair girl stepped lightly into the room, and, having daintily
removed the dust from her feet by wiping them on one of BIGLOW AND
SONS' Patent Crocodile Matting Rugs (delivered carriage free within a
radius of twelve miles of their establishment at Ludgate Circus) that
was placed before the door, gave a hasty glance round the apartment.
She saw at ones from the octagonal ebonised table three feet six, by
two feet five inches, the afternoon lounge couch (as advertised), the
gent's easy shake-down chair, ladies ditto, and half dozen occasional
chairs, all upholstered in rich material in Messrs. MULGRAVE & Co. of
170, Walbrook, City, E.C.'s best style, that a refined taste inspired
by a wholesome economy had been exercised in the furnishing of the
apartment, and she turned to the old Duke with a grateful nod of
recognition.

"What," he asked, in a feeble voice, "is it my own ANGELICA? Surely it
is! Come, my child, let me look at you?" He turned up the burner of
a BOYCOTLE's Patent Incandescent Gas Lamp (price 13s. 9d. with full
paper of instructions complete), and as he stood erect in his rich
calico-lined fox-fur dressing-gown (supplied in three qualities by
BROHAM & Co, with a discount of 15 per cent. for cash), he looked,
every foot of him, a worthy scion of that ancient family of which he
was the last living representative. "Let me look at you," he again
repeated, drawing his neatly-dressed granddaughter more fully into the
light before him. As it fell upon the graceful curves of her lissom
figure, it was easy to perceive that she was wearing one of Madame
BEAUMONT's celebrated Porcupine Quill Corsets, which lent a wonderful
finish to a two-guinea tailor-made gingham cloth "Gem" costume,
braided with best silk (horn buttons included), which showed off her
young form to such advantage.

He would have added more, but a sudden pallor stole over his
complexion, and he reeled towards a chair.

In an instant the bright girl was on her knees at his side. "Dear
Grandfather, you are faint!" she cried, an expression of alarm
suffusing her beautiful features.

The Duke pointed to a small table--"My Liquid Pork!" he gasped. "Ah!
of course!" was her quick response, as she bounded across the room,
and returned with an eleven-and-sixpenny bottle of "BOLKIN's
Liquid Pork, or, the Emaciated Invalid's Hog-wash"--a stimulating,
flesh-creating, life-sustaining food; sold in bottles at 1s. 1½d.,
2s. 9d., 5s. 7d., and 11s. 6d.,--of which she quickly poured out half
a tumbler, and raised it to the quivering lips of the staggering old
nobleman by her side. "How foolish of me not to have thought of this
before!" she continued, replenishing the glass, which he emptied in
feverish haste.

"I save threepence-halfpenny in a sovereign," he went on, a
wicked twinkle kindling in his eye as he spoke, "by taking the
eleven-and-sixpenny size--and that _is_ a consideration, my dear. If
you don't think so now, with all your young life before you, you will
when you come to be my age!"

[Illustration]

He sank back in his arm-chair as he spoke, apparently about to deliver
himself to the calm delights of a retrospective _rêverie_. But he was
not destined to enjoy it. At that moment a whiff of stifling smoke,
quite choking in its intensity, forced itself under the door. In
another moment the matter was soon explained. With a wild rush the
butler burst into the room.

"Fly, your Grace, for your life!" he cried; "the place is on fire!"

A blaze of flame that followed the terrified menial into the room,
only too truly corroborated his statement. In a another moment the
fire had seized hold of the new furniture, and in greedy fury, as
if it were some demon spirit, licked the walls with great tongues of
flame.

"In the cupboard, my dear," said the Duke, the proud blood of his
race coming to his aid in a perfect and commanding coolness in the
face of the terrible danger that faced him, "you will find three cans
of JOBSON's Patent Fire Annihilating Essence. It is advertised as
infallible. Give one to the butler, take one yourself, and give the
third to me. This appears to be a good opportunity for testing its
efficacy."

The quick bright girl instantly obeyed his injunction. The cans were
distributed, and opened. A colourless gas was liberated. In a few
seconds the flames were entirely quenched.

"Ah!" said the old Duke, flinging himself back into his armchair with
a sigh of relief. "And now, ANGELICA, my dear, you can tell me why you
came to see me!"

"DADDY, I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME FIVE SHILLINGS A WEEK POCKET-MONEY!"

THEORY AND PRACTICE.

(_TO BE REPRESENTED DURING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CHRISTMAS
PANTOMIME._)

    SCENE--_Interior of Private Box. Grandfather and Grandchildren
    discovered listening to the Overture. Father and Mother in
    attendance._

_Grandfather_. Yes, my dears, I am glad to say that the afterpart is
_not_ to be discontinued. You are to see the Clown, and the Pantaloon,
and the Columbine, and the Harlequin.

[Illustration: Peg-Top after seeing a Pantomime.]

_Chorus of Grandchildren_. Oh! Oh, won't that be delicious!

_Grandfather_. Yes, my dears, you will see the regular old-fashioned
comic business that used to delight _me_ when _I_ was a boy. I
remember when I was about your age, my dears, seeing TOM MATHEWS, and
it was _so_ amusing. He used to sing a song--

_Chorus_ (_interrupting as the Curtain rises_). Hush, Grandpa! it's
going to begin! (_The party subside, and direct their attention to
twenty sets or so of the most magnificent scenery, illustrated by
gorgeous Processions. The hands of the clock revolve, leaving Eight
and reaching Eleven, when Grand Transformation takes place, amidst
various coloured fires. Then enter_ Old Christmas Clown.)

_Old Christmas Clown_. Here we are again! How are you to-morrow?

_Chorus of Children_. Oh, we are _so_ tired! And we have heard that
before!

_Mother_. And I am afraid we shall miss our train.

_Father_. And the roads are _so_ bad!

_Grandfather_. Well, well, perhaps we had better go; but in my time we
all used to enjoy it _so_ much. (_Aside._) And perhaps, after all, the
red-hot poker business _is_ rather stale at the end of the Nineteenth
Century!

VOCES POPULI.

A CHRISTMAS ROMP.

    SCENE--_Mrs. CHIPPERFIELD's Drawing-room. It is after the
    Christmas dinner, and the Gentlemen have not yet appeared.
    Mrs. C. is laboriously attempting to be gracious to her
    Brother's Fiancée, whose acquaintance she has made for the
    first time, and with whom she is disappointed. Married Sisters
    and Maiden Aunts confer in corners with a sleepy acidity._

_First Married Sister_ (_to Second_). I felt quite sorry for FRED,
to see him sitting there, looking--and no wonder--so ashamed of
himself--but I always will say, and I always _must_ say, CAROLINE,
that if you and ROBERT had been _firmer_ with him when he was younger,
he would never have turned out so badly! Now, there's my GEORGE--&c.,
&c.

[Illustration]

_Mrs. C._ (_to the Fiancée_). Well, my dear, I don't approve of young
men getting engaged until they have some prospects of being able to
marry, and dear ALGY was always my favourite brother, and I've seen so
much misery from long engagements. However, we must hope for the best,
that's all!

_A Maiden Aunt_ (_to Second Ditto_). Exactly what struck _me_, MARTHA.
_One_ waiter would have been quite sufficient, and if JAMES _must_
be grand and give champagne, he might have given us a little _more_
of it; I'm sure I'd little more than foam in _my_ glass! And every
plate as cold as a stone, and you and I the only people who were not
considered worthy of silver forks, and the children encouraged to
behave as they please, and JOSEPH PODMORE made such a fuss with,
because he's well off--and not enough sweetbread to go the round. Ah,
well, thank goodness, we needn't dine here for another year!

_Mr. Chipperfield_ (_at the door_). Sorry to cut you short in your
cigar, Uncle, and you LIMPETT; but fact is, being Christmas night, I
thought we'd come up a little sooner and all have a bit of a romp....
Well, EMILY, my dear, here we are, all of us--ready for anything
in  the way of a frolic--what's it to be? Forfeits, games, Puss in
the Corner, something to cheer us all up, eh? Won't anyone make a
suggestion? [_General expression of gloomy blankness._

_Algernon_ (_to his Fiancée--whom he wants to see shine_). ZEFFIE,
you know no end of games--what's that one you played at home, with
potatoes and a salt-spoon, _you_ know?

_Zeffie_ (_blushing_). No, _please_, ALGY! I don't know _any_ games,
indeed, I couldn't, _really_!

_Mr. C._ Uncle JOSEPH will set us going, I'm sure--what do _you_ say,
Uncle?

_Uncle Joseph_. Well, I won't say "no" to a quiet rubber.

_Mrs. C._ But, you see, we can't _all_ play in that, and there _is_ a
pack of cards in the house somewhere; but I know two of the aces are
gone, and I don't think all the court cards were there the last time
we played. Still, if you can manage with what is left, we might get up
a game for you.

_Uncle J._ (_grimly_). Thank you, my dear, but, on the whole, I think
I would almost rather romp--

_Mr. C._ Uncle JOSEPH votes for romping! What do you say to Dumb
Crambo? Great fun--half of us go out, and come in on all-fours, to
rhyme to "cat," or "bat," or something--_you_ can play that, LIMPETT?

_Mr. Limpett_. If I _must_ find a rhyme to cat, I prefer, so soon
after dinner, not to go on all-fours for it, I confess.

_Mr. C._ Well, let's have something quieter, then--only _do_ settle.
Musical Chairs, eh?

_Algy_. ZEFFIE will play the piano for you--she plays beautifully.

_Zeffie_. Not without notes, ALGY, and I forgot to bring my music with
me. Shall we play "Consequences"? It's a very quiet game--you play it
sitting down, with paper and pencil, you know!

_Mr. Limpett_ (_sardonically, and sotto voce_). Ah, this is something
_like_ a rollick now. "Consequences," eh?

_Algy_ (_who has overheard--in a savage undertone_). If that isn't
good enough for you, suggest something better--or shut up!

    [_Mr. L. prefers the latter alternative._

_Mr. C._ Now, then, have you given everybody a piece of paper, EMILY?
CAROLINE, you're going to play--we can't leave _you_ out of it.

_Aunt Caroline_. No, JAMES, I'd rather look on, and see you all
enjoying yourselves--I've _no_ animal spirits now!

_Mr. C._ Oh, nonsense! Christmas-time, you know. Let's be jolly while
we can--give her a pencil, EMILY!

_Aunt C._ No, I can't, really. You must excuse me. I know I'm a
wet blanket; but, when I think that I mayn't be with you another
Christmas, we may _most_ of us be dead by then, why--(_sobs_).

_Fred_ (_the Family Failure_). That's right, Mater--trust you to see a
humorous side to everything!

_Another Aunt_. For shame, FRED! If you don't know who is responsible
for your poor mother's low spirits, others do!

    [_The Family Failure collapses._

_Mr. Limpett_. Well, as we've all got pencils, is there any reason why
the revelry should not commence?

_Mr. C._ No--don't let's waste any more time. Miss ZEFFIE says she
will write down on the top of her paper "Who met whom" (must be a Lady
and Gentleman in the party, you know), then she folds it down, and
passes it on to the next, who writes, "What he said to her"--the next,
"What she said to him"--next, "What the consequences were," and the
last, "What the world said." Capital game--first-rate. Now, then!

    [_The whole party pass papers in silence from one to another,
    and scribble industriously with knitted brows._

_Mr. C._ Time's up, all of you. I'll read the first paper aloud.
(_Glances at it, and explodes._) He-he!--this is really very funny.
(_Reads._) "Uncle JOSEPH met Aunt CAROLINE at the--ho--ho!--the
Empire! He said to her, '_What are the wild waves saying?_' and she
said to him, 'It's time you were taken away!' The consequences were
that they both went and had their hair out, and the world said they
had always suspected there was something between them!"

_Uncle J._ I consider that a piece of confounded impertinence!

    [_Puffs._

_Aunt C._ It's not true. I _never_ met JOSEPH at the Empire. I
don't go to such places. I _didn't_ think I should be insulted like
this--(_Weeps._)--on Christmas too!

_Aunts' Chorus_. FRED _again_!

    [_They regard Family Failure indignantly._

_Mr. C._ There, then, it was all fun--no harm meant. I'll read the
next. "Mr. LIMPETT met Miss ZEFFIE in the Burlington Arcade. He
said to her, 'O, you little duck!' She said to him, 'Fowls are cheap
to-day!' The consequences were that they never smiled again, and the
world said, 'What price hot potatoes?'" (_Everybody looks depressed._)
H'm--not bad--but I think we'll play something else now. [_ZEFFIE
perceives that ALGY is not pleased with her._

_Tommy_. (_To Uncle JOSEPH_). Uncle, why didn't _you_ carve at dinner?

_Uncle J._ Well, TOMMY, because the carving was done at a side
table--and uncommon badly done, too. Why do you want to know?

_Tommy_. Parpar thought you _would_ carve, I know. He told Mummy she
must ask you, because--

_Mrs. C._ (_With a prophetic instinct._) Now, TOMMY, you mustn't tease
your Uncle. Come away, and tell your new Aunt ZEFFIE what you're going
to do with your Christmas boxes.

_Tommy_. But mayn't I tell him what Parpar said, first?

_Mrs. C._ No, no; by and by--not now! [_She averts the danger._

    [_Later; the Company are playing "Hide the Thimble;" i.e.,
    someone has planted that article in a place so conspicuous
    that few would expect to find it there. As each person catches
    sight of it, he or she sits down. Uncle JOSEPH is still,
    to the general merriment, wandering about and getting angrier
    every moment._

_Mr. C._ That's it, Uncle, you're _warm_--you're _getting_ warm!

_Uncle J._ (_Boiling over._) _Warm_, Sir? _I am_ warm--and something
more. I can tell you! [_Sits down with a bump._

_Mr. C._ You haven't _seen_ it! I'm sure you haven't seen it. Come
now, Uncle!

_Uncle J._ Never mind whether I have or have not. Perhaps I don't
_want_ to see it, Sir!

_The Children_. Then do you give it up? Do you want to be told? Why,
it's staring you in the face all the time!

_Uncle J._ I don't care whether it's staring or not--I don't want to
be told anything more about it.

_The Children_. Then you're _cheating_, Uncle--you must go on walking
till you _do_ see it!

_Uncle J._ Oh, that's it, eh? Very well, then--I'll walk!

    [_Walks out, leaving the company paralysed._

_Mrs. C._ Run after him, TOMMY, and tell him--quick! [_Exit TOMMY._

_Mr. C._ (_feebly_). I think when Uncle JOSEPH does come back, we'd
better try to think of some game he _can't_ lose his temper at. Ah,
here's TOMMY!

_Tommy_. I _told_ him--but he went all the same, and slammed the door.
He said I was to go back and tell you that you would find he _was_ cut
up--and cut up rough, too!

_Mrs. C._ But what did you tell _him_?

_Tommy_. Why, only that Parpar asked him to come to-night because he
was sure to cut up well. You said I might!

BLACK AND WHITE; OR, THE PHANTOM STEED!

(_A TYPICAL GHOST STORY FOR CHRISTMAS, BY A WITNESS OF THE TRUTH._)

[Illustration]

I was walking in one of the slums in the neighbourhood of Oxford
Street, some years ago, and always fond of horse-flesh (I had
driven--as a boy--a bathing-machine for my pleasure along the wild
coast line of the great Congo Continent) was greatly attracted by
a hack standing within the shafts of a cart belonging to a funeral
furnisher. Like many of its class, the horse was jet black, with a
long flowing tail and a mane to match. As I gazed upon the creature
the driver came out of the shop (to which doleful establishment the
equipage belonged) and drove slowly away. I felt forced to follow, and
soon found myself outside a knacker's yard. Guessing the intention of
the driver to treat his steed as only fit for canine food, I offered
to purchase the seemingly doomed animal. To my surprise, the man
expressed his willingness to treat with me, and suggested that I might
have the carcase at the rate of 4s. 11¾d. a pound. Considering the
price not excessive, I agreed, and, having weighed the horse at an
automatic weighing machine, I handed over £100--in notes. Then the
first strange thing happened. Before I could replace my pocket-book in
its receptacle in my coat, the driver had absolutely vanished! I could
not see him anywhere. I was the more annoyed at this, as I found that
(by mistake) I had given him notes on the Bank of Elegance, which
everyone knows are of less value than notes on the Bank of England.
However, it was too late to search for the vendor, and I walked
away as I could, leading by the bridle the steed I had so recently
acquired.

It was now necessary to get quarters for the night, but I found, at
that advanced hour, that many of the leading hotels were either full
or unwilling to supply me with a bedroom-and-stable-combined until the
morning. I was refused firmly but civilly at the Grand, the Métropole,
the Grosvenor, and the Pig and Whistle Tavern, South East Hackney.
At the latter caravanserai, the night-porter (who was busying himself
cleaning the pewter pots) suggested that I should go to Bath.
Adopting this idea, I mounted my steed (which answered, after a little
practice, to the name of _Cats'-meat_), and took the Old Kent Road
until I reached St. Albans.

[Illustration: Everything comes to him who _waits_.]

It was now morning, and the old abbey stood out in grand outline
against the glorious scarlet of the setting sun. Entering an inn,
I called for refreshment for man and beast, and, having authority
for considering myself qualified to act as representative of both,
consumed the double portion. Thinking about the whiskey I had just
discussed, as I rode along, I came to a milestone, standing on its
head, and a sign-post in the last stage of hopeless intoxication. It
was here that a police constable turned his lantern upon me with a
pertinacity that apparently was calculated to challenge observation.
Annoyed, but not altogether surprised, I declared my opinion that it
was "all right," and fell asleep. When I awoke, I found that I had
travelled some hundreds of miles, and, strange to say, my horse was as
good as when it had started. From what I could gather from the signs
on the road (I have been accustomed to Forestry from my earliest
childhood), it seemed to me that, while I was slumbering, I must
have passed Macclesfield, Ramsgate, Richmond (both in Surrey and
in Yorkshire), and was now close to the weirdest spot in all
phantom-populated Wiltshire--a place in its rugged desolation
suggestive of the Boundless Prairies and BUFFALO BILL--Wild-Westbury!
Greatly fatigued, I entered a second inn, and enjoyed a hearty meal,
which was also a simple one. I am a liquidarian, and take no animal
or vegetable food, and have not tasted fish for nearly a quarter of a
century.

When I wished to continue my journey to Bath, I found _Cats'-meat_
so disinclined to move, that I thought the best thing to do in the
interest of progress, was to carry him myself. He was very light--so
light that I imagined the automatic weighing-machine must have been
out of order when I tested it. Almost in a trance I walked along,
until, stumbling, I fell, and dropped _Cats'-meat_ into a well. And
then another strange thing happened. The horse with its jet-black tail
and mane, emerged from the water as white as snow! Apparently annoyed
at the treatment to which it had been accidentally subjected, it
fled away, and I lost sight of it amongst the hills that overlook
Wild-Westbury. And then the strangest thing of all happened, and has
been happening ever since!

[Illustration: Interesting to the Medical Profession. "The Annual
Indigest."]

In clear weather, on the side of one of these hills, _Cat's-meat_, in
the habit as he stood when he left the well on that fatal day, may
be seen patiently waiting until the time shall arrive when he shall
receive a coat of blacking, a companion steed to share with him his
labours, and a hearse! I am not the only person who has seen him thus.
The spectre (if it be a spectre) is known for miles around, and has
been watched by thousands. Nay, more. On occasions of great rejoicing,
when merry-making has been the order of the day or night, several
_Cats'-meats_ have appeared to the carousing watchers strangely
blended together. Speaking for myself, if I have seen one I have seen
half-a-dozen--nay, more--with hills to match! And those who do not
believe me can continue the journey I once commenced, and (after
I have wished them a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year) proceed
to--Bath!

CHRISTMAS "CRACKERS."

Plum-pudding never disagrees with me, _however much I take of it_.
No more do mince-pies, _no matter how many I eat_. Steaming
hot-and-strong gin-punch is _the most wholesome beverage_; so,
also, is brandy-punch. It can't harm anybody who, on the Pickwickian
principle, "takes enough of it." Both beverages go admirably with
cigars and pipes. If you have anything like a headache on Boxing-day
morning, depend upon it, it comes from abstemiousness in drinking,
eating, and smoking.

FIGHTING THE FOG.

(_A SEASONABLE HINT._)

Sir,--I have read several letters in the papers complaining of the
fog, and asking not only how one is to protect the system from its
injurious effects, but also soliciting information as to how one is
to safeguard oneself against street accident, if obliged to quit the
premises during its prevalence. The first is simple enough. Get a
complete diver's suit, put it on, and let an attendant follow you with
a pumping apparatus, for the purpose of supplying you with the fumes
of hydro-bi-carbon (DAFFY's solution) in a state of suspension. This
will considerably assist the breathing. To avoid street accident,
wear an electric (SWANN) light, five hundred candle power, on the top
of your hat, round the brim of which, in case of accident, you have
arranged a dozen lighted night-lights. Strap a Duplex Reflector on to
your back, and fasten a Hansom cab-lamp on to each knee. Let a couple
of boys, bearing flaming links, and beating dinner-gongs, clear the
way for you, while you yourself shout "_Here comes the Bogie Man!_"
or any other appropriate ditty, through a fog-horn, which you carry
in one hand, while you spring a policeman's ancient rattle vigorously
with the other. You will, if thus provided, get along capitally.
Be careful at crossings, for your sudden appearance might possibly
frighten an omnibus horse or two, and cause trouble.

I haven't tried all this _yet_ myself, but a friend of mine at Colney
Hatch assures me he has, and found it a great success. As I think,
therefore, it may prove a boon to your numerous readers, I place it at
your disposal with much pleasure, and have the honour to be, Sir,

Your obedient servant, A CAUTIOUS CARD.

THE CHRISTMAS COLLEGE FAIRY.

CHAPTER I.--_THE STRANGE VISITOR._

On the evening of the 24th of December, 1874, the Senior Dean of St.
Michael's, the Reverend HENRY BURROWES, was sitting in his comfortable
rooms in the Great Court. He had, for reasons of his own, decided
to spend the Christmas Vacation in Cambridge. His bed-maker, Mrs.
JOGGINS, had entered a mild protest, but it been unavailing. Mr.
BURROWES was a man of forbidding aspect and of unbending character.
During the five years that he had held his office, he had enforced
discipline at the point of the bayonet, as it were, and he boasted
with pardonable pride that he had broken the spirit of the haughtiest
and least tractable of the Undergraduates. Everybody had been gated at
eight o'clock. Many had been sent down. Tears and denunciations were
alike unavailing. The ruthless Dean had pursued his course without
flinching. A very mild reading-man had attempted his life by dropping
a Liddell and Scott on to his head from a first-floor room. This
abandoned youth had been screened by his comrades, and had ultimately
escaped in spite of the efforts of the justly incensed Dean.

[Illustration]

It was nine o'clock. The bells at St. Mary's were ringing the
customary curfew. The Dean was seated before the fire in his
arm-chair. An open book, a treatise on some abstruse question of pure
mathematics, lay on the table by his side. He was meditating on his
past exploits, and planning new punishments. But somehow there was
a strange sinking at his heart. What could be the reason of it? The
dinner in hall had been of the usual moderate excellence, he had
only drunk a bottle and a half of claret. "Pshaw," he said, "this is
folly. I have not been severe enough. Conscience reproaches me. I am
unmanned." He rose and paced about the room. At this moment his door
opened, and the familiar figure of Mrs. JOGGINS appeared.

"Beg your pardon, Sir," she said, hesitatingly, "I thought you
called."

"No, Mrs. JOGGINS," said the Dean. "I did not call. Are you not rather
late in College? Is it usual for you to stay--" Here the Dean stopped
abruptly. He rubbed his eyes, and clung to his book-shelf for support.
His hair stood on end, and his knees shook. In fact he expressed
terror in a thoroughly orthodox manner, for he had suddenly become
aware that there was in the face of Mrs. JOGGINS a strange radiance,
and that two gossamer wings had suddenly appeared on her back in place
of the substantial shawl she was wont to wear. Mr. BURROWES gazed * *
* then consciousness forsook him.

CHAPTER II.--_A STRANGE STORY._

How long he lay he knew not. When he came to himself it was broad
daylight, and he was walking through the Great Court hand in hand with
Mrs. JOGGINS.

"See," she said, "there is Dr. GORGIAS," and sure enough there stood
the redoubtable Master in the centre of one of the grass-plots in a
bright red dressing-gown and slippers, with an embroidered smoking-cap
upon his head. He was engaged in distributing crumbs to a congregation
of sparrows and thrushes and redbreasts.

"Good morning, BURROWES," said the Master; "how's your poor feet? Can
you catch. One, two, three, heads!" and with that he flung the crust
he held in his hand at the astounded Dean, and landed him fairly on
the right cheek. Dr. GORGIAS then executed a pirouette, kissed his
hand to Mrs. JOGGINS, and disappeared into the Master's lodge. "From
this good man," said Mrs. JOGGINS to the Dean, "you may learn a
lesson of unassuming kindness; but time presses; we must hurry on. By
virtue of the power vested in me by the Queen of the Fairies, whose
ambassadress I am in Grantaford, I have summoned back to St. Michael's
all the Undergraduates. You shall see them." In vain the miserable
Dean protested that he had seen too much of them. The Fairy JOGGINS
was inexorable. She waved her wand, a yard of butter congealed to
the hardness of oak by the frosty morning, and in a moment the Court
was filled with Undergraduates. They were all smoking, and suddenly
the Dean became aware that he too had a lighted cigar in his mouth,
and was puffing at it. At the same moment he discovered that he
was wearing a disgracefully battered college-cap, and a brilliant
"blazer," lately invented by a rowdy set as the badge of their
dining Club. He shuddered, but it was useless. He put his hand in his
coat-pocket. It contained a bottle of champagne.

The Undergraduates now formed a procession and began to defile past
him. "Smoking in the Court, half-a-crown," said one, in a dreadful
voice. "Mr. BURROWES irregular in his attendance at Chapel, gated at
eight," roared a second. "Mr. BURROWES persistently disorderly, sent
down for the term," shouted a third; and then they all began to caper
round the hapless man whom the Fairy Queen had betrayed into their
power. They taunted him and reviled him. "You have mined our homes,
poisoned our fathers' happiness, undermined the trusting confidence of
our mothers. You have been a bad man. You must perish!" and thus the
dreadful chorus went on while the Dean stood stupidly in the centre of
the throng puffing violently at one of the largest cigars ever seen in
St. Michael's. At last the Fairy waved her wand again, and in a moment
the shouts ceased and the crowd disappeared. "See," she said, "the
result of intemperate disciplinarian zeal!" But Mr. BURROWES neither
heard nor heeded. He had collapsed.

CHAPTER III.--_WIDE AWAKE!_

It was Christmas Morning. Mr. BURROWES was still sitting in his chair
before the fire-place, but the fire was out. He woke and looked round.
Mrs. JOGGINS had just come in, and was staring at him in surprise.

"Lor, Sir," she said, "what a turn you give me, sitting here in your
keepin'-room. I never knew you to do sech a thing before as sit up
all night." But the Dean had fallen on his knees before her, and was
babbling out prayers for pardon and vows of reform.

CHAPTER IV.--_A CHRISTMAS MORN._

In the following term the whole system of College management was
changed. Mr. BURROWES from a tyrant turned into the most amiable of
men. The Undergraduates became idyllic. Even Dr. GORGIAS submitted
to the benign influence of the Fairy JOGGINS. But it is noticeable
that Mr. BURROWES who still resides at St. Michael's, objects to any
mention of the Christmas of 1874. This is the only exception to his
universal amiability.

  But, ere I started with my mates

  And now, just as I'm going to dine,

  Ere we at Wimbledon can meet,
    Those horrid gaps!--that treacherous sludge!
  I shall not get one skimmer fleet.
    After my long and sloppy trudge.
  No go! One more lost Saturday!
    To skating's joys I'm still a stranger.
  I sit and curse the melting ray,

  It means soft ice, chill slop, and--"Danger!!!"

[Illustration: L60/310-1: Illuminated 'M']

"_Mon frère_" said DINARZADE JACQUES MORLEY to SCHEHERAZADE HARCOURT,
"_si vous ne dormiez pas, je vous supplie, en attendant le jour, qui
paraîtra bientôt, de me raconter un de ces beaux contes que vous
savez._"

"Certainly, my dear JACK," said SCHEHERAZADE.

Now DINARZADE did not like this flippant tone of address. He was, as
has been recorded by SHAHSTEAD (a gentleman of whose patronage he is
proud) not a man you may take liberties with. For SCHEHERAZADE, taking
mean advantage of a French agglomeration of letters which did not
represent his name, to hail him as "JACK" was characteristic, and
therefore undesirable. But, as everybody knows, DINARZADE, at the
approach of each successive morning, was obliged to make this appeal
to his brother, in order to circumvent the bloodthirsty designs of the
Sultan (for particulars of which, see original). So he dissembled his
anger, and SCHEHERAZADE proceeded to tell the History of the Second
Old Man, and the Black Dog.

"Sire," he said, "whilst the Merchant and the First Old Man, who
conducted the hind, went their way, there arrived another Old Man, who
led a black dog, and who forthwith proceeded to relate his history.
'We were, you know,' he remarked, leaning wearily on his staff, 'two
brothers, this dog that you see, and myself. In early life we were not
tied by those bonds of affection that should exist in family circles.
In fact, on one occasion, I had to put my brother in prison. He had
not at that period assumed the four-footed condition in which you now
behold him. He walked about on two legs, like the rest of us, ate and
drank, made love, and made merry. After he had been in prison some
time, successful interposition was made on his behalf by a friend
named Le Sieur O'SHAY. But that (as RUDYARD KIPPLING observes) is
another story.

"'Some time after my brother came to me and proposed to make a long
journey involving close business relations with him. I at first
declined his proposition. "You have been in business some time," I
said to him, "and what have you gained? Who is to assure me that I
shall be more fortunate than you?"

"'In vain he encouraged me to stake my fortune with him, but he
returned so often to the charge that, having through six years
constantly resisted his solicitations, I at last yielded. I realised
all my property, took my brother into partnership, stocked our vessel
exclusively with Home Rule goods, and set out on our voyage.

"'We arrived safely, did a great stroke of business with our wares,
bought those of the country, and set forth on our return voyage. Just
as we were ready to re-embark I met on the seashore a lady, not at
all bad looking, but very meanly dressed. She approached me, kissed
my hand, begged me to take her for my wife, and conduct her to my home
across the sea. This may seem to our friend JACK MORLEY a somewhat
hasty proceeding. JACK is a philosopher, but I am the Second Old Man,
a mere child of nature. I took her into Bond Street, and bought her a
new dress, and, having duly married her, we set sail. Perhaps I should
add that her maiden name was IRELAND.

"'My brother and she got on very well at first, and he loudly
professed to share the esteem and (considering she was my wife I may
say) affection with which I regarded her. But suddenly a change came
over him. One night whilst we slept he threw us overboard into the
sea. My wife turned out to be a fairy, and, as you may imagine, she
was not born to be drowned. As for me I was, so to speak, on my way to
be as dead as a herring, when she seized me and transported me to an
isle. When it was day the fairy said to me, "You see, my husband, that
in saving your life I have not badly recompensed you. I am, as you
doubtless begin to suspect, a fairy. Finding myself on the seashore
when you were about to embark, I felt strongly drawn towards you.
Desiring to prove the goodness of your heart, I presented myself in
the disguise with which you are familiar. It was, I admit, a trifle
shabby. You have used me generously. I am delighted to have found
occasion to repay you; but as for that brother of yours, I am death on
him. I shall never rest till I have taken his life."

"'"I beg you to do no such thing," I said.

"'"I will sink his vessel and send him to the bottom of the sea," she
insisted.

"'After much endeavour I managed to appease her wrath, and in
the twinkling of an eye, before you could say "Ali Baba!" she had
transported me back to my own house. On entering I found this black
dog who stared strangely at me.

"'"My husband," said the fairy, "do not be surprised to see this
dog here; he is your brother. He has behaved in a most shocking way
towards you. He has maligned you, misrepresented you, threatened you,
even called you a Grand Old Spider. I have condemned him to remain in
this state till you have concluded your little transactions in Home
Rule."

"'"But my dear!--" I said.'"

At these words SCHEHERAZADE, remarking that it was daybreak, ceased to
pursue his narrative.

even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
